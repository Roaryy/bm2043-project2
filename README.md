##  Introduction
Created a terminal-based tool for creating and modifying graphs, supporting operations like adding/removing nodes and edges, and displaying graph properties.

## Features
- **Add Nodes**: Dynamically insert new nodes into the graph.
- **Remove Nodes**: Delete nodes and automatically remove associated edges.
- **Add Edges**: Connect nodes with undirected edges.
- **Remove Edges**: Disconnect nodes by removing edges between them.
- **Display Graph**: Visualize the graph structure through its adjacency list.
- **Graph Properties**:
  - Total number of nodes.
  - Total number of edges.
  - Degree of each node.
 
  ## Technologies Used
- **Graphs**: Used for representing relationship between nodes.
- **Linked Lists**: Utilized for traversal of data.

## How to Run the Code
- **Terminal**: The code can be directly ran on Terminal.

- **Local Host**: You can run on localhost which provde better User Experience and User Interference 

### How to Run the Server on Localhost
Follow these steps to run the server on your localhost:
1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:
   Open a terminal and change the directory to the location where the server files are stored:
   ```
   cd /path/to/server/directory
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Server**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. **Verify Server is Running**: Once started, the server will be live on http://localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port specified in the server's configuration (usually 3000 or 5000).

**Note** - Make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system.

### Example Run on localhost
